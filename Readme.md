## This project is about learning the following C++ concepts.

- RAII
- Smart pointers
- Ownership and lifetime

How can we achieve memory safety by using RAII and scopes. Also, create memory safe classes for the case of an exception happening.
By using RAII we create objects, that are being unloaded and deleted from memor in case of leaving scope and in an exception.
